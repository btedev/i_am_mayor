NowIAmMayor
===========

Small example of addressing internationalization, localization, and accessibility in iOS apps.  This is not meant to be complete nor is the app idea itself especially useful.  It allows you to tweet that you're the "mayor" of a location without ever signing up on Foursquare.  It raises the level of oversharing by tweeting how much you spent as well.  

The completed project will have at least two significant tags for "non-i18n" (the ugly American version) and later one or more versions localized to non-English languages.
